# Easy-Tickets-uisng-Face-Recognition
To buy tickets for the train or metro, sometimes common man has to suffer a lot in a queue. To get rid of this problem we made an Easy Ticket System where no one need to stay in a queue to buy the tickets. We made a website named Easy Tickets where a users has to create their account. Whenever user creates an account our website will capture some snapshots of the face of a user. This website has a wallet where user can add his money. We have made two different modules which has to run 24x7 on the railway or metro stations.
1. Entry Module:
This module will run on the entry cameras of the station and record each and every face entering into the station.
2. Exit Module:
This module will run on the exit cameras of every station and record faces exiting the stations.

Whenever a user enters the station and exits on any station, our system will detect the user and deduct the fair between entry and exit station from the user's wallet. Users can see their past transactions on our website.

# Key Features:
1. Our website has a very easy to use interface.
2. Our website is also having face unlock feature to login.
